# Overview

- Markets enable efficient allocation of resources across time and states of nature
    - Workers get to invest for retirement. Without markets, you can only consume
    - Farmers get to hedge against bad weather. Without markets, only spot market available

- Role of markets
    - Gather information
    - Aggregate liquidity i.e. supply and demand
    - promote efficiency and fairness

- FM products satisfy needs
    - hedge risk
    - allow speculation
    - raise funds
    - fund liabilities

- Modelling markets
    - discrete time models
        - single period models
        - multi period models
    - continuous time models

- pros/cons of discrete time models
    - Pros: Less sophisticated mathematics
    - Cons: No close form solutions, require numerical calculations

- This course will focus on **discrete time multi-period models**
    - Small amount of continuous time concepts - Black Scholes

- Financial Economics vs Financial Engineering
    - Financial Econ: Price equities, bonds, assets + how to set interest rates
    - Financial Engg: Assume prices of equities and interest rates are given
        - Price derivatives on assets using no-arbitrage condition
    - No complete separation
        - e.g. CAPM is covered in both 

- 3 central problems of FE
    - Security Pricing

        - Tail risk: Probability of large losses
        - Value at risk and conditional value at risk
        - Becoming impt in portfolio selection
